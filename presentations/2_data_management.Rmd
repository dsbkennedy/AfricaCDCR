## Objects

### In R, everything is an object

So far we have installed, loaded and used a package (`readxl`)

But how do we use the information generated from these actions?

We assign the information to "objects"

[Section in Epidemiologist for R handbook about Objects](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html#objects)

*"Everything you store in R - datasets, variables, a list of village names, a total population number, even outputs such as graphs - are **objects** which are **assigned a name** and **can be referenced** in later commands."*

To explain objects, we will calculate a value, assign it to an object and then use the object for a second calculation.

```{r}
2+2
```

We can assign the calculation "2+2" to an object called "a"

```{r}
a <- 2+2
```

We can then use the object a to show the results of the calculation

```{r}
a
```

We can also use this value for further calculations such as adding 4 to the object a

```{r}
a + 4
b <- a+4

```

The result of this calculation is now stored in the object "b"

```{r}
b
```

### Assigning data to an object

In the previous section, we used the function `read_xlsx` from the package `readxl` to import data from an Excel spreadsheet.

But we didn't assign this to an object, so it is not possible to use the data from the import step.

We can assign the data to an object and then conduct further analysis.

```{r}
africa_covid_cases <- read_xlsx(here('data','AfricaCovid','AfricaCovid.xlsx'), sheet="Infected_per_day")
```

You will now see the object in the "Environment" section of R Studio.

Now the data have been assigned to the object "`africa_covid_cases`", we can start to work with the data.

## Data types

## Dates

## Working with data

In the `africa_covid_cases` object, there are 53 obs (observations) of 492 variables.

So what does this mean?

We can look at our data to get more information

```{r}
africa_covid_cases
```

ISO - 3 letter code assigned to each country

COUNTRY_NAME - Name of the country

AFRICAN_REGION - African region

43831, 43832, 43833 - This looks like a date format used by Excel. It is the number of days since January 1, 1970.

## Working with data - other ways to look at data

*Show the first 5 rows of the data frame*

The command `head` tells R that we want to see the first few rows and `n=` specifies how many rows we want to see.

```{r}
head(africa_covid_cases, n=5)
```

Show the last 7 rows

```{r}
tail(africa_covid_cases, n=7)
```

How many unique countries are in the data?

```{r}
unique(africa_covid_cases$COUNTRY_NAME)
```

There are 53 unique country values. This is helpful as there are also 53 rows so we can say that each row represents a country.

We can assign the list of unique countries to an object for future reference

```{r}
country_list <- unique(africa_covid_cases$COUNTRY_NAME)
```

## Working with data - looking at one variable

In the previous step, the following command was used

unique(africa_covid_cases\$COUNTRY_NAME)

What does "\$" do in R?

It allows us to look at a specific variable within the dataset

```{r}
unique(africa_covid_cases$AFRICAN_REGION)
```

And again we can assign this to an object

```{r}
region_list <- unique(africa_covid_cases$AFRICAN_REGION)
```

## The tidyverse

When using R, there are many approaches you can use to reach the same result.

There are thousands of packages with many functions and sometimes these packages can overlap.

This can be confusing when you are starting to learn R.

There is a collection of packages with many of the most commonly used packages and this is called the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_packages()
```

We will use functions from some of these packages over the next few sessions.

## The tidyverse: Tidy data

The key concept when working with packages from the tidyverse is the concept of "tidy data".

[R for Epidemiologist handbook 4.1 From Excel - Tidy data](https://epirhandbook.com/transition-to-r.html?q=tidy#tidy-data)

Principles of "[tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)":

1.  Each variable must have its own column
2.  Each observation must have its own row
3.  Each value must have its own cell

## The tidyverse: Why is this important?

Functions from the tidyverse packages are set up to work with tidy data.

If your data are not tidy, then you will have to restructure the data to a tidy format.

Restructuring can take a lot of time if the data are stored in Excel spreadsheets with a lot of formatting/merged columns.

[![Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration. By Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst.](images/tidy_messy_data-01.jpg){width="250"}](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/)

## The tidyverse: Checking if data are tidy

In a previous step, we imported COVID case data from an Excel spreadsheet.\
But how do we know if the data are "tidy"

Remember there are 3 principles

1.  Each variable must have its own column
2.  Each observation must have its own row
3.  Each value must have its own cell

```{r}
head(africa_covid_cases, n=3)
```

So are the data "tidy"?

The data from the spreadsheet are not "tidy".

The columns "43831, 43832, 43833..." represent different dates. Therefore, this does meet the second argument of "tidy data" - "Each observation must have its own row".But we can reformat the data to make it "tidy" using functions from the packages included in the tidyverse

Remember, first we must install the packages from the tidyverse

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

## The tidyverse: Tidying data

Now that the `tidyverse` has been installed, we can use the functions from the packages to "tidy" the data.One package which is very helpful for this is called "`tidyr`. Instead of loading individual packages, we can load the core tidyverse packages with one command

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The core packages contain powerful functions we can use to process, analyse and visualise data.

Remember to look at the documentation for a package type "?[name of package]"

Example -

`?tidyr`

To look at the functions within a package, type [name of package]::

Example

`tidyr::`

To reformat the data to a tidy format, we need to transform the data from wide to long.

The Epidemiologist R handbook has an excellent section describing how to do this

12 - [Pivoting data](https://epirhandbook.com/pivoting-data.html?q=pivot_long#pivoting-data)

## The tidyverse: Wide to long

## [![From the Epidemiologist R handbook](images/wide_to_long-01.png){width="600"}](https://epirhandbook.com/pivoting-data.html?q=pivot_long#wide-to-long)

```{r wide_to_long}
africa_covid_cases_long <- africa_covid_cases %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=4:492, names_to="excel_date", values_to="cases")

```

Transforming data from wide to long usually requires a few attempts to ensure you have achieved the correct outcome!

```{r}
head(africa_covid_cases_long, n=3)
```

This looks correct!

You can add comments to code to show other people (and remind yourself!) why you wrote the code in a particular way

```{r wide_to_long_example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
africa_covid_cases_long <-
  africa_covid_cases %>% #tell R to use this dataset
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:492,#select the columns you want
               names_to = "excel_date", #name the new date column
               values_to = "cases") #name the new cases column

```

## Working with dates

[![](images/date_format_example.gif)](https://iso.mit.edu/americanisms/date-format-in-the-united-states/)

To add to the confusion, Excel has 2 additional date systems:

1.  1900 date system

2.  1904 date system

    ![https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/date-systems-in-excel-e7fe7167-48a9-4b96-bb53-5612a800b487](images/excel_date_format.png){width="780"}

In the data set we are using, the dates are in this format:

```{r}
head(africa_covid_cases_long$excel_date)
```

We can use a function from another package to convert this to a standard date format.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=T}
install.packages("janitor")
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
```

The package [`janitor`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html) has many helpful functions for cleaning data

```{r}
africa_covid_cases_long <- africa_covid_cases_long %>% 
  mutate(date_format=excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(excel_date)))

head(africa_covid_cases_long$date_format)
```

The new variable created "date_format" is in the format YEAR-MONTH-DATE.

We can also check if the values in the new variable look correct

```{r}
min(africa_covid_cases_long$date_format) #minimum date
max(africa_covid_cases_long$date_format) #maximum date
```

We know this is a data set of COVID cases so the date range (from the start of 2020 through to May of 2021) looks to be correct.
