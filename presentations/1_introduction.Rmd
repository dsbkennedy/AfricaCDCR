## Course structure

Presentations built around content developed for the [Epidemiologist R handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/)

-   An excellent resource for all skill/experience levels

-   Direct towards specific sections for you to work through in your own time

-   2 hours sessions, twice a week to present key topics and answer questions

## Why R?

[![Why Learn R? 10 Handy Reasons to Learn R programming Language](images/reasons_to_learn_R-01.jpg){width="400"}](https://data-flair.training/blogs/why-learn-r/)

## Installing R

For this course, you will need to install 2 items:

1.  R programming language

2.  R Studio

    -   Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

    -   A very helpful resource for writing and running R code

    You will need to install them in this order - First R, then R studio

## Setting up files and folders

### Best practice

Setting up files and folders will make your analysis (and life!) easier

-   Folder structure

-   Naming files and folders

### Folder structure

R Studio works best when you use its project function

-   Each project contains all of your inputs, outputs and code

-   This also makes it easier to share folders with colleagues

    -   Everything is in one place!

Projects are covered in more detail in the Epidemiologist R handbook: [Chapter 6 "R Projects"](https://epirhandbook.com/r-projects.html)

### Naming files and folders

If you want to share your code with colleagues or when you return to code after several weeks/months you will be grateful that you gave your files and folders meaningful names!

Many organisations have style guides to ensure that teams can collaborate on coding projects

-   [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html#names)

[![Tidyverse Style Guide - 1.2 Organisation](images/code_organisation.png){width="800"}](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html#names)

-   Key points to remember for naming

    -   Keep the name short

        -   Instead of "*data_import_of_file_for_analysis.R*"

            -   "*import_file.R*"

    -   Avoid spaces!

        -   Instead of "*import file.R*"

            -   "\_" "*import_file.R*"
            -   "-" "*import-file.R*"
            -   camelCase "*importFile.R*"

## Navigating in R studio

## R packages

What is an R package?

*An R package is a collection of functions which you can use to import, clean, analyse and report your data*

Link to Epidemiologist R handbook - 3.7 "[Packages](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html#packages)"

Packages can simplify your workflow by combining multiple steps into a smaller number of commands

Example: [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) is a package of functions used to import data from Excel to R.

### Installing a package

install.packages("readxl")

We have asked R to install the package "readxl".

The installation has been successful. You do not need to re install the packages every time you start a new project as they are saved in your library.

-   In R, red text does not mean there has been an error!

    You will now be able to see the package in your list of packages

    ![](images/install_readxl.png){width="250"}

### Loading a package

Now that `readxl` has been installed, you will be able to load it and use its functions

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

![](images/load_readxl.png){width="250"}

When the package has been successfully loaded, you will see a tick mark in the box.

#### Pacman

It is good practice to load all packages at the start of a script. This can help you to see which packages are being loaded and it ensures that you can write code without interruptions from the `library` command.

There is a package called `pacman` which can help with this process. When you run `pacman::p_load` you can list all of the packages you want to load. If the package has not previously been installed, `pacman` will install it. If the package has been installed, `pacman` will load it.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(readxl,here)
```

### Using a package

Each package has multiple functions that you can use on your data.

To read more about a particular package, type

```{r}
?readxl
```

![Help documentation for readxl](images/help_readxl.png){width="250"}

## Importing data

For this example, we want to import data that is currently stored in an Excel formatted file ".xlsx"

So we can use the function *read_xlsx f*rom the `readxl` package

```{r}
read_xlsx(here('data','AfricaCovid','AfricaCovid.xlsx'))
```

But what does this show? And how can we use it?

-   Before importing a file from Excel, it may be helpful to open it in Excel so we can see what data are stored in the file

![](images/africa_covid_screenshot.png){width="250"}

So when we tell R to use the function read_xlsx, it reads the first sheet which is called "ReadMore".

It looks like this is a summary sheet with information about when data for each country was last updated.

So how do we tell R to read in a different sheet from the Excel file?

*Question - How many confirmed cases of COVID were recorded across Africa in July 2020?*

First step - Import data from the sheet containing information on COVID cases

We can use the `excel_sheets` function from `readxl` to get the names of all sheets in the Excel workbook

```{r}
excel_sheets(here('data','AfricaCovid','AfricaCovid.xlsx'))
```

From this list we can see that we want to import data from the sheet "Infected_per_day".

```{r}
read_xlsx(here('data','AfricaCovid','AfricaCovid.xlsx'), sheet="Infected_per_day")
```

We can see a snapshot of the data from the sheet "Infected_per_day"
